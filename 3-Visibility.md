In Solidity, **function visibility** determines how and where a function can be accessed. Solidity provides four visibility modifiers: `public`, `private`, `internal`, and `external`. Each one defines specific rules about who can call the function and from where.

### 1. **`public`**

- **Access**:
  - Can be called from within the contract.
  - Can be called from derived (child) contracts.
  - Can be called externally via transactions or other contracts.
- **Behavior**:
  - Automatically creates a "getter" for state variables (if marked `public`).
- **Use Case**:
  - Functions that should be accessible to everyone (both inside and outside the contract).

**Example**:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Example {
    string public name = "Solidity";

    // Public function
    function getName() public view returns (string memory) {
        return name;
    }
}
```

In this example, `getName` can be called from within the contract, child contracts, and externally via transactions.

### 2. **`private`**

- **Access**:
  - Can only be called **from within the contract** where it is defined.
  - Not accessible from derived (child) contracts or externally.
- **Use Case**:
  - Helper or utility functions that are meant for internal calculations or logic.

**Example**:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Example {
    uint private secret = 42;

    // Private function
    function _getSecret() private view returns (uint) {
        return secret;
    }

    function revealSecret() public view returns (uint) {
        return _getSecret();
    }
}
```

In this example, `_getSecret` is private and can only be used within the `Example` contract.

---

### 3. **`internal`**

- **Access**:
  - Can be called from within the contract.
  - Can also be called by derived (child) contracts.
  - Cannot be accessed externally.
- **Use Case**:
  - Functions or state variables meant to be shared only with inherited contracts.

**Example**:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Parent {
    uint internal number = 100;

    // Internal function
    function _getNumber() internal view returns (uint) {
        return number;
    }
}

contract Child is Parent {
    function accessParentNumber() public view returns (uint) {
        return _getNumber(); // Accessing internal function from parent
    }
}
```

Here, `_getNumber` is `internal` and accessible in both `Parent` and `Child`.

---

### 4. **`external`**

- **Access**:
  - Can only be called from outside the contract (via transactions or from other contracts).
  - Cannot be called from within the contract directly (use `this.<function_name>()` if needed).
- **Behavior**:
  - More gas-efficient than `public` for external calls.
- **Use Case**:
  - Functions designed specifically to be invoked externally.

**Example**:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Example {
    // External function
    function externalFunction() external pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello from external function!";
    }

    function callExternal() public view {
        // This will throw an error
        // externalFunction();

        // Correct way
        this.externalFunction();
    }
}
```

In this example, `externalFunction` can only be called externally or through `this`.

### Summary of Function Visibility:

| Visibility | Accessible in Contract | Accessible in Derived Contract | Accessible Externally |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| `public`   | ✅                     | ✅                             | ✅                    |
| `private`  | ✅                     | ❌                             | ❌                    |
| `internal` | ✅                     | ✅                             | ❌                    |
| `external` | ❌ (directly)          | ❌                             | ✅                    |

### Notes:

- For **state variables**, the `private` and `public` modifiers apply, but `internal` and `external` do not.
- **`external` vs `public`**:
  - `external` functions are optimized for external calls and cannot be called internally.
  - `public` functions can be accessed both internally and externally, making them slightly less efficient for external calls.

By choosing the appropriate visibility modifier, you can effectively manage how your contract’s functions are exposed and ensure robust access control.
